SafeOnline Web Service Runtime

 This project creates the Sun JAX-WS RI runtime WAR that hosts all the SafeOnline JAX-WS web services.
 
 We're assuming the availability of a JAX-WS RI 2.1.1-p1-SNAPSHOT runtime within the deploying J2EE container.
 
 Add new web service endpoints to <<<WEB-INF/sun-jaxws.xml>>>.
