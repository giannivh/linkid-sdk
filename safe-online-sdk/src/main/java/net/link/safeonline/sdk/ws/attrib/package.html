<p>This package contains the client component for the attribute web
service. This web service is using the SAML v2 protocol.</p>

<p>Via this web service an application can retrieve the attributes
of a certain subject. Only attributes for which the user confirmed the
corresponding application identity are accessible via the attribute web
service.</p>

<p>Compounded attributes are handled via annotated java classes. The
annotations to be used for this are {@link
net.link.safeonline.sdk.ws.attrib.annotation.Compound} and {@link
net.link.safeonline.sdk.ws.attrib.annotation.CompoundMember}.</p>
