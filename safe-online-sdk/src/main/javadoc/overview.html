        <h1>SafeOnline SDK</h1>

        <p>This document contains the API documentation for the SafeOnline
           SDK. The SafeOnline SDK contains Java components to ease the
           communication with the SafeOnline services. These services are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authentication web application: can be used by an application
                to authenticate a user.
            </li>
            <li>Attribute web service: can be used by applications to retrieve
                attributes from subjects that confirmed the corresponding application
                identity.
            </li>
            <li>Data web service: can be used by applications to perform CRUD
                operations on subject attributes if they are assigned the attribute
                provider role.
            </li>
            <li>Name Identifier Mapping web service: can be used by
                application to map a username to the corresponding user identifier.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Besides client components for these web service you'll also find various
        components in this SDK to ease integration of the SafeOnline
        authentication mechanism within servlet container based web
        applications.
