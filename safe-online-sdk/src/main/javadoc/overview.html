<h1>SafeOnline SDK</h1>
<p>This document contains the API documentation for the SafeOnline
SDK. The SafeOnline SDK contains Java components to ease the
communication with the SafeOnline services. These services are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Authentication web service: can be used by application that
	can collect the user credentials themselves.</li>
	<li>Attribute web service: can be used by application to retrieve
	attributes from subjects that confirmed the corresponding application
	identity.</li>
	<li>Data web service: can be used by application to perform CRUD
	operations on subject attributes if they are assigned the attribute
	provider role.</li>
</ul>
Besides client components for these web service you'll also find various
components in this SDK to ease integration of the SafeOnline
authentication mechanism within servlet container based web
applications.
