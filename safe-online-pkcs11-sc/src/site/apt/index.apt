SafeOnline PKCS#11 SmartCard Library

 This project hosts the client-side Java6 library to interact with PKIX PKCS#11-based SmartCard devices.
 This generic library is not targeting any specific type of smart card.
 Configuration and code for specific type of smart cards (like for example the Belgium eID card) should be grouped separately.
