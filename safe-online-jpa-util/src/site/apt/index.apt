SafeOnline Java Persistence API Utility library

 This utility library contains helper classes to ease the working with JPA named queries.
 
 The problem with JPA named queries is that you don't have a strongly-typed interface that
 expresses what goes in and what comes out from the named queries.
 
 Via the <<<QueryObjectFactory>>> we have solved this problem.
